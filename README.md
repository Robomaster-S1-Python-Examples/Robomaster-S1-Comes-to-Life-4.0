'''Robomaster S1 Comes to Life 4.0'''

Created by Joseph C. Richardson, GitHub.com

Make Robomaster S1 come to life. Simply copy or download this program example.

You must copy and paste the program code into your Robomaster app. After that,
simply click the blue play button, then clap your hands three times to wake him
up. To make him sleep, simply tap any one of his bottom hit detectors.

This Robomaster S1 program example uses four powerful random generator
functions. The random.randint(), the random.choice(), the random.choices() and
random.shuffle() functions. These four random generator functions are what make
the Robomaster S1 come to life and appear to have a mind of its own.

To avoid damaging your Robomaster S1, never set any speeds higher than they
are shown here, especially in smaller play areas. Note: be cautious when setting
the drive_speed variable higher than 0.3 and the seconds variable, who's default
is 2 seconds per drive time distance.

IMPORTANT! Never pick up or move the Robomaster S1, while its program is
running. Doing so may cause damage to the unit; you must stop the program first.

Please note: new and improved features and updates will always
continue to grow as I learn more, each and every day.

I sure hope other Robomaster S1 people find this program very
enjoyable and useful. I sure put a lot of time into creating it.
It sure wasn't no cakewalk when the gimbal and chassis would conflict
each other during practice execution/runs before I finally figured it
all out. So please enjoy...
