Learning how to program the Robomaster S1 in Python

Note: you must install the Robomaster S1 app, either on your wireless
mobile device or on your computer, via Wi-Fi. Next after installing
the Robomaster S1 App, you will have to update the firmware for the
Robomaster S1. Next you must calibrate the Robomaster S1 so it can
work properly.

Note: to be able to program the Robomaster S1 in Scratch or Python,
you must run the Robomaster S1 app, then connect the Robomaster S1
to it, via wireless mobile device or on your computer, via Wi-Fi.

To avoid damaging your Robomaster S1, never set any speeds higher
than they are shown here, especially in smaller play areas. Note:
be cautious when setting the drive_speed variable higher than 0.3
and the seconds variable, who's default is 2 seconds per drive time
distance.

IMPORTANT! Never pick up or move the Robomaster S1, while its
program is running. Doing so may cause damage to the unit; you
must stop the program first.

I sure hope other Robomaster S1 people find this program very
enjoyable and useful. I sure put a lot of time into creating it.
It sure wasn't no cakewalk when the gimbal and chassis would conflict
each other during practice execution/runs before I finally figured
it all out. So please enjoy...
